-- functions

---Gets the current position of the specified touch-press, in pixels.
---The unofficial Android and iOS ports of LÃ–VE 0.9.2 reported touch-press positions as normalized values in the range of 1, whereas this API reports positions in pixels.
---@param id lightuserdata @ The identifier of the touch-press. Use love.touch.getTouches, love.touchpressed, or love.touchmoved to obtain touch id values.
---@return number x @ The position along the x-axis of the touch-press inside the window, in pixels.
---@return number y @ The position along the y-axis of the touch-press inside the window, in pixels.
function touch.getPosition(id) end

---Gets the current pressure of the specified touch-press.
---@param id lightuserdata @ The identifier of the touch-press. Use love.touch.getTouches, love.touchpressed, or love.touchmoved to obtain touch id values.
---@return number pressure @ The pressure of the touch-press. Most touch screens aren't pressure sensitive, in which case the pressure will be 1.
function touch.getPressure(id) end

---Gets a list of all active touch-presses.
---The id values are the same as those used as arguments to love.touchpressed, love.touchmoved, and love.touchreleased.
---
---The id value of a specific touch-press is only guaranteed to be unique for the duration of that touch-press. As soon as love.touchreleased is called using that id, it may be reused for a new touch-press via love.touchpressed.
---@return table touches @ A list of active touch-press id values, which can be used with love.touch.getPosition.
